Questions to answer:
- When selecting an already played level, should the player start from scratch, reload the way it was left, or give an option?
- How large should levels be?
- Should speed be tied to size?
- Keyboard/Mouse Controls
- Consider making the game a metroidvania maybe?
- Make list of all unlocks and think how to spread them out.
- Think up level themes.

Notes:
- Make missions take place on seperate background or seperate layer to not overwrite what player drew on main.
- Project Settings > Rendering > Environment > Default Clear Color
- DON'T make edges of platforms black
- Never set PlayerMask to invisible. Stops painting from working
- Make sure Player's paint signal is connected to something to paint
- Dummy_Button is just a button to test a feature without having to worry about any other input and SHOULD BE REMOVED IN FINAL BUILD!!!

Dialogue Tree Notes:
- Conditionals in Dialogue Tree are handled as strings. Use placeholders to put info back into them.
- PassCondition tells if the conditional is true or not
- MUST Ctrl+S to save Dialogue Tree!!!!

TODO Notes:
- Supports TODO, HACK, BUG, FIXME, and NOTE
- Just write that on a line where you want it to take you and when you click on it it'll warp you to it.
